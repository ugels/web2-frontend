          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I was born in Elverum, Norway. And moved shortly after to Horten,
            which is where i am still residing to this day
          </p>
          <p>
            I have developed a great interest in the digital world, and you can
            often find me infront of my pc where i will be trying to either make
            something to challenge myself, or just playing games with friends
          </p>

        <div id="about-par1">

          <p>
            No, my story is more than just where I live. Let's dvelve into the
            beginning and explore my journey that unfolds over time.

            <div class="infobox">
              <h3>Early Years</h3>
              <p>
                Born in Elverum, Norway, and later moved to Horten. Horten is
                the definition of home to me, all the good memories and tired
                days after bicycling to school
              </p>
              <p>
                Now i think i could probably trace my interest in technology
                back to when i got my first pc. I was so excited because it came
                with a copy of StarCraft II which i had watched my dad play
              </p>
              <p>
                This first laptop introduced me to the wonderful world of
                technology, now i had no clue how to do anything as the onyl
                thing i had used before that was an ipad. But i tried my best to
                learn this new system
              </p>
              <p>
                After some time on the pc i decided i wanted to Learn Scratch. A
                box-coding language based in the browser, and seeing my
                enthusiasm my dad signed me up for a local scratch course which
                i attended and quickly mastered
              </p>
              <p>
                Scratch felt pretty limiting at the time, because i wanted to
                make my own game. But because all the big programming languages
                looked so scary to learn i postponed my coding adventure
              </p>

            <div class="infobox">
              <h3>Passion for the Digital World</h3>
              <p>
                I felt like the laptop i had started with put a limit to what i
                could achieve, so i saved up money and bought parts for a "real"
                computer
              </p>
              <p>
                With help from my dad i put the pc components together and got
                the pc running
              </p>
              <p>
                From this point on i got completely addicted to the digital
                world. I started as a news-paper boy so i could earn money to
                buy a vr headset when i was 13
              </p>
              <p>
                I also steadily upgraded my pc with better parts so that i could
                run more programs, and play new games with increased performane
                in the company of my friends
              </p>
              <p>
                I poured many hours into playing games with friends. I even
                started modding some of them like Minecraf and Terraria, and
                while playing i also put some time away to increase my digital
                skills
              </p>
              <p>
                This led me to unlock many new possibilites and make a lot of
                new friends, and in 9th grade i found the game Rust
              </p>
              <p>
                Rust helped me develop my leadership skills and my technical
                capabilites. Me and two of my friends started a Group named GMB
                where we often lead 20-30 people in Rust
              </p>
              <p>
                I also developed a Discord bot that we added to our server to
                calculate expenses in rust, examples of this could be how much
                sulfur we would need create 10 rockets
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of secondary school i discovered how much i enjoy
                Cyber Security. And i made an encryption service in python that
                used AND encryption to encrypt/decrypt inputed messages
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently attending Horten videregående skole, in the
                Informational Technology and Media Production line.
              </p>
              <p>
                I choose the IT and MP line because it allowed me to further
                grow my intrest in IT.
              </p>
              <p>
                However something unexpected happend, i also really enjoyed the
                Media Porducation. Where we would plan filming and film projects
              </p>
              <p>
                My time at Horten Vgs has really taught me how to work on
                projects as a group and time management
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also always tought of education as an important part of
                my future so when i first started VGS i took T1 mathematics as a
                private person (privatist).
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking T1 math really put me to the test, i had to study without
                any teacher's guidance and on my freetime. On top of that i only
                had just above 2 months to learn an enitre corriculum

            experience where players could join teams representing either oxygen
            or carbon dioxide. The game simulates the battle between these two
            elements, with players working together to reduce carbon emissions
            or increase oxygen levels.
